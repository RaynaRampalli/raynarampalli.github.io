								<h3>Current Research Interests: We Exist in the (Galactic) Context</h3>
								<p> I use stars as tools to understand the Milky Way's evolution and the planets within it. We are at an exciting time in astronomy, where the many large astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric surveys of stars in our Galaxy
								have begun to unify and entangle the sub-fields of exoplanets, stars, and galaxies. Much of my work is representative of this shift. Click the tabs to read more, stay tuned for future updates, and please contact me if you're interested in collaborating!

<p>	<b> Is the Sun's apparent refractory depletion associated with its status as a planet host? (Not necessarily) </b> </p>

<p>
	The Sun shows a trend of apparent relative depletion in refractory elements
	with increasing condensation temperature compared to 80% of its Sun-like counterparts <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...865...68B/abstract" > (Bedell+2018)  </a>, 
	but the source of this relative depletion is unknown. 
	Early work from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...704L..66M/abstract" > Melendez+09 </a>, posits that the terrestrial planets have locked up these refractory elements. 
	More recently, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.5079B/abstract" > Booth and Owens (2020) </a> suggested that giant planets (e.g. Jupiter) can create dust traps preventing the infall of refractory rich dust onto the host star.
	In this work we aim to determine if this apparent refractory depletion is due to the planets in the solar system 
	by comparing refractory abundances for solar analogs and identified solar analog planet hosts. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We infer abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mn, Cr, Si, Fe, Ni, Mg, V, Ca, Ti, Al, and Y for > 17,000 solar analogs (50 of which are planet hosts) with Gaia RVS spectra (R=11,200) using the Cannon, a data-driven method 
		<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...808...16N/abstract" > (Ness+2018)  </a>.
		We find that the Sun remains refractory depleted compared to other Sun-like stars regardless of our current knowledge of the planets they host. 
		This is inconsistent with the above theories of various types of planets locking up or sequestering refractories. 
		Read the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...965..176R/abstract" > here. </a> 
		This work was done in collaboration with Professor <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~mkness/Home.html" > Melissa Ness</a>, Dr. <a href="https://grahamedwards.github.io/" > Graham Edwards</a>, Professor <a href="https://newton.host.dartmouth.edu/index.html" > Elisabeth Newton</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://bedell.space/" > Megan Bedell</a>. Stay tuned for future updates on our ongoing efforts to figure out what's up with the Sun!

Linear fits of solar analogs (navy filled circles), close-in giant planet hosts (purple unfilled circles), giant planet hosts (pink unfilled diamonds), and terrestrial/small planet hosts (green squares) for element mean abundances and respective standard errors of the means from Na (958 K) to Y (1659 K). 
The slopes are indistinguishable within the errors, suggesting the increased relative depletion with condensation temperature of the Sun is unrelated to our current knowledge of planet host status.

<button class="accordion"> Young stars in Eccentric Orbits </button>
<div class="panel">
		<br>
  <p>	<b> When was the last fast-acting dynamical event in our Solar neighborhood (Maybe as recently as < 120 Myr years ago!) </b> </p>

	<p>

		<img src="images/Figure (10).jpg"  align=right width="500"

		The kinematics of stars in our Galaxy carry information about their dynamical history. It is generally assumed that stars are born on near-circular orbits,
		but over their lifetimes, their orbits can be dynamically perturbed to a more eccentric state.


		Corrugations of stars (hereafter referred to as wrinkles) in the solar neighborhood have been found at eccentric orbits using Gaia DR2 kinematics
		as shown in rectangular boxes in the figure reproduced from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03653" > Trick+19 </a>. Note these data are plotted in galactic action space, but you can interpret this plot as
		size of stellar orbit versus eccentricity of stellar orbit about the Galaxy.</p>
		<p>
		Spiral arm resonances are one of the few dynamical phenomena that can kinematically heat stars from near-circular (or low radial actions in Galactic action space) to highly eccentric orbits (high radial actions) quickly,
		and simulations have shown that this process uniquely leaves wrinkles of eccentric stars like those seen in the observational data. </p>





<p>


		Young stars should not be found in eccentric orbits unless they were subject to a fast-acting dynamical event (e.g. a spiral arm resonance).
		Gyrochronologically age-dating the youngest stars in these orbits will lend insight into the dynamical phenomena that placed them there.

	</p>
<p>



	We build and apply rotation period measurement pipelines to likely single stars with TESS light curves in two interesting regions of kinematic space, where these wrinkles are present.
		We identify 141 unique, rapidly rotating stars in highly eccentric orbits in the disk, some of which appear as rotationally young as the 120-Myr-old Pleiades. </p>

		Amy Smock (University of Arizona), and Prof. Kate Daniel (University of Arizona).  </p>

<button class="accordion"> Stellar Rotation Period Stability </button>
<div class="panel">
	<br>

	<p>	<b> Are star spots a reliable way of measuring stellar rotation periods (Yes!) </b> </p>

	<p> My primary project as a Bridge scholar involved measuring rotation period stability for low-mass stars in the 670-Myr open cluster, Praesepe, with
			Professor <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~marcel/" > Marcel Agüeros</a> and his group including Dr. Jason Curtis, <a href="https://stephanietdouglas.science/" > Prof. Stephanie Douglas</a>, and <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~alejandro/" > Dr. Alejandro Núñez</a>.  </p>

		<p>	Gyrochronology, or the use of stellar rotation to infer ages
			of low-mass stars, has been shown to be a promising age-dating method for stars of unknown ages. As stars age, they lose angular momentum as a result of their magnetic fields carrying
			away stellar material. This in turn slows their rotation at a predictable timescale that we determine by empirically calibrating age-rotation relations using stellar populations of known ages (e.g. open clusters) as shown in the figure from  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08830" > Bouma+23 </a> .</p>

			<img src="images/BoyleBouma23.png"  align=left width="500"
     height="auto" style="padding-left: 10px"/>

		<p>	In order to measure stellar rotation, we rely on modulations in stellar light curves as a result of star spots periodically orbiting in and out of our view (Gif Credit:  <a href="https://jradavenport.github.io/" >  Dr. James Davenport </a>). Therefore, it
			is important to ensure the period we measure from photometry is intrinsic to the star rather than a particular spot alignment at the time. </p>

			<img src="images/starspot.gif" align=right width="500"
     height="auto" style="padding-left: 10px"/>
			<p>	We test this by measuring
			rotation periods for Praesepe stars with 2-3 K2 observational campaigns (C5, C16, and C18) worth of observations. We find that in > 95% of the cases we are able to measure the
			same period within an average of 0.3% indicating that a rotation period measurement is in fact representative of the star's intrinsic behavior. In this process,
			we also measure periods for > 200 additional rotators, including 33 found in the newly discovered tidal tails of the cluster. Read the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13250" > here</a>. </p>

				Period-period comparisons by K2 campaign: C5 vs. C16 (left), C16 vs. C18 (middle),
				C5 vs. C18 (right). We see that > 95% of the stars' rotation period measurements in each subplot fall along the 1:1 ratio line well within the 10% of each other indicated with the shaded grey region. There
				is also a low rate of harmonics in which we observe double or half the period.

		<p>	<b> How many stellar labels (parameters) does it take to predict the variance in a star's spectrum and associated
			abundances? (4 for Gaia-RVS-resolution surveys) </b> </p>



<p>	During my time as a Bridge scholar, I worked with Professor <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~mkness/Home.html" > Melissa Ness</a>
to understand the dimensionality of chemical abundance information in the Gaia-RVS calcium-triplet-region spectra (expected in the third data release from the Gaia Mission). </p>

<p> We fit a quadratic model of four primary sources of variability described by the stellar labels of effective temperature, surface gravity,
	metallacity, and alpha-enrichment to the flux of spectra from the Gaia-RVS-like ARGOS survey. We find that models capture 85% of variance in the ARGOS spectra and that the
	largest residuals are concentrated around the calcium lines, as confirmed by a principal component analysis. This result likely marks departures from the completeness of the 1D-LTE label
		assumption. </p>

	<span class="image fit"><img src="images/argos.png"<figcaption>
		Example of ARGOS spectrum and its four-label model with prominent absorption features labeled. Data in pink with model
		over-plotted with blue dashed line. Residuals in black and noise threshold plotted with grey dashed line.

		</figcaption> </span>

<p>	 Using the same four-label model with the Gaia-RVS-like RAVE-on Catalog, we check to see if we can infer measured Si, O, Ca, Ni, and Al abundances and find that we can. Running the same test with
		the higher-resolution APOGEE survey, we find that a measurement uncertainty of <0.03 dex is required to capture additional information from these elements. Thus, a four-label model
		is sufficient in describing chemical abundance variance for SNR < 200 in Gaia-RVS spectra. Read the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02218"> here</a>. </p>

	the r-squared goodness of fit metric of the model, the bias, and the rms difference of the (Reference-Inferred) abundance. The
	mean error is also included at bottom. The prediction is to within the error reported on the reference individual
	abundance labels, meaning four labels are sufficient to describe the full set of abundances to this precision.

<button class="accordion">K2 308b: an NGC 1817 interloper</button>
<div class="panel">
	<br>

<p>	<b> Did we find the first transiting hot Saturn candidate in an open cluster? (No) </b> </p>

<p>
	As part of my senior thesis, I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~vanderburg/" > Andrew Vanderburg</a>, Dr. Dave Latham, Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quinnsam/" > Sam Quinn</a>, and <a href="https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~abieryla/" > Allyson Bieryla</a>
		to test techniques for improving planet candidate validation in star-crowded fields of the K2 mission. This was done to prepare for the issues forseen with the large pixels of the TESS mission.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this process, we discovered K2-308b, a hot saturn-sized planet thought to be associated with the 1-Gyr-old open cluster NGC 1817. Planets found in
		open clusters are extremely valuable since the age of the host star is easily determined and thus helps us constrain timescales for various planet formation and evolution scenarios. While we ultimately find that the
		planet's star is a field star incorrectly presumed to be a cluster member using Gaia DR2 astrometry, we note that a technique tested in my senior thesis, seeing-limited photometry, is a useful method for planet candidate validation,
		particularly in crowded fields. Read the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158...62R/abstract" > here. </a>
