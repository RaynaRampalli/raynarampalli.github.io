								<h3>Per Aspera ad Astra: Through Hardship to the Stars </h3>
								<p> Astronomy is appealing in large part because it feels so far removed from the day-to-day problems we face here on
								Earth. But we know gatekeeping practices in the sciences can start as early as middle school. As a 
								result, a significant component of my work as a South Asian woman scientist includes advocating for recruitment and retention of folks from historically
								marginalized backgrounds through activities including targeted institutional and department initiatives, stem advocacy forums, and science communication. 
								You can read more about my outreach efforts below.

								<h4> Selected Retention and STEM Advocacy Efforts</h4>
										
																			<ul>
												<li> E.E. Just Graduate Fellow and mentor for Dartmouth College's 
												<a href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/eejust/about/about-program">E.E. Just Program</a> to support and prepare students from historically marginalized communities for
												careers in STEM. </li>
												
												<li> Current Member of Dartmouth physics and astronomy equity, diversity, and inclusion
												working group.</li>
												
										
												
												<li> Co-organizer of Wellesley astronomy and physics departments’ post-baccalaureate dialogues: activities included
identifying and inviting speakers, managing department colloquia, and publicizing events.</li>

												<li> Initiated the project "Perspectives on the Wellesley College Physics Department: Where We’ve Been and Where
We’re Going" to formally document the history of women in physics of Wellesley College to foster faculty-student
conversations about curriculum. <a href="images/Physics Matters.pdf">Results</a> were presented at the annual Wellesley College Ruhlman Conference. Outcomes included faculty restructuring curriculum to better meet current students’ needs. </li>


<li> Conducted forums and workshops on STEM advocacy using the AAUW and NSF's  <a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/">"Why So Few" research report</a> in Sacramento area high schools and California State University
Sacramento. </li>

<li> Congressional intern for Rep. Ami Bera and Rep. Doris Matsui focusing on STEM education. </li>

												
											</ul>
								
								

								<h4> Science Communication </h4>
								<p> In the process of trying to make physics and astronomy an inviting and accessible space
									for folks of all backgrounds, I have also volunteered at many public observing nights
									at the observatories in the Maria Mitchell Association, Wellesley College, Columbia University,
									and Dartmouth College. I also take great pride in sharing my
									science at places that were formative in the development of my interest in science 
									such as the <a href="https://powerhousesc.org/"> Powerhouse Science Center/Museum of Science and Curiosity</a>
									and the Sacramento Regional Science and Engineering Fair.
