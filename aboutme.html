								<p> Hi there! Welcome to my page. I am an astronomy graduate student at Dartmouth College, who uses stars to understand
									both planet and Galactic evolution. </p> 
								
								<p> I was born and raised in Sacramento, California. <span class="image right"><img src="images/telescope.JPG" alt="" /></span> I was born and raised in Sacramento, California. <span class="image right"><img src="images/telescope.JPG" alt="" /></span> Inspired by its legacy of women astrophysicists, I attended Wellesley College and dabbled in research projects ranging from exoplanets to galaxies beyond our own. 
									After college, as a post-bac  in Columbia’s Bridge Program, I became interested in stellar ages and chemical abundances as tools for understanding our own Milky Way’s formation and evolution (or the subfield of Galactic archaeology). 
									This perspective now shapes how I study planets and their hosts in Prof. Elisabeth Newton’s group at Dartmouth, focusing on how both local conditions and broader Galactic environments influence their evolution.


</p>
									<p> In addition to studying the stars and planets around us, I am committed to creatively finding ways to 
									improve inclusion efforts and improving retention of students in STEM, particularly those from historically marginalized groups. I consider this work
									very much a part of the scientific process. </p>
									<p> Besides astronomy research and outreach, I find time to swim, practice yoga, arrange flowers, and scope out which local café has the best iced teas.  </p>
