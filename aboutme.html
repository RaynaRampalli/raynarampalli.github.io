								<p> Hi there! Welcome to my page. I am an astronomy graduate student at Dartmouth College, who uses stars to understand
									both planet and Galactic evolution. </p> 
								
								<p> I was born and raised in Sacramento, California. <span class="image right"><img src="images/telescope.JPG" alt="" /></span> Motivated by astronomy experiences and the women mentors I had in high school, 
									I chose to attend Wellesley College, home to a lineage of inspiring women astrophysicists. 
									At Wellesley, I engaged in research projects from extragalactic work to planet occurrence rates. 
									For my senior thesis, I worked at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics on exoplanet candidate validation. 
									After college, as a post-bac at Columbia University’s Bridge Program, I pivoted to thinking about stellar age-dating methods and chemical abundance space. 
									This continued interest in stars and planets led me to Prof. Elisabeth Newton’s group at Dartmouth college</p>
									<p> In addition to studying the stars and planets around us, I am committed to creatively finding ways to 
									improve departmental inclusion efforts and improving retention of undergraduate students, particularly those from historically marginalized groups. I consider this work
									very much a part of the scientific process. </p>
									<p> Besides astronomy research and outreach, I find time to swim, practice yoga, arrange flowers, and scope out which local café has the best iced teas.  </p>
